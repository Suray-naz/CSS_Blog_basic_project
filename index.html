            <h2>MANTY-STEAMED DUMPLINGS</h2>
            <p>This Steamed Dumplings Recipe (Манты) is one of the many recipes that reminds me of my childhood. It's really fun creating a website of my favourite recipes that we eat. I just love all this food, and Manti are no exception. Manti are very common in Central Asia/Eurasia from China, Russia, the Stany countries (Türkmenistan, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan...) and all the way across post Soviet countries. </p>
